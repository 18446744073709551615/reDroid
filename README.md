reverse-engineering tools for Android NDK/C++/Qt

What it is
==========

It is a collection of tools that one may borrow.
You will have to read the source and pick up the necessary pieces.


What it's not
=============

It's not a product.
It compiles, but the .so library is useless; the code worked in a _different_ project.
